        <p>
            Life is a happening puzzle in our early days, but as we grow more and more old, we start to realize the meaning of life and the pattern with which it goes on. It actually is nothing but creation, followed by preservation and then destruction.

            The world is nothing but a game of balance. Thereâ€™s always going to be bad in order to balance out the good.
